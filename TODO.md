## Find a way to get full XP a player has
There is no way to get the amount of XP a player has... Once we have one, add the following config node:

```
# When preserve-xp is true, AngelChest can either take the
# full XP a player had, or the amount that would be normally dropped.
# When set to false, take the normally dropped amount of XP
# When set to true, take the full amount of XP a player had
full-xp: false
```
