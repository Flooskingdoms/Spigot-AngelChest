## Strange stuff before 1.13:
- Item names. For better compatability, we will just state 1.13+ as compatible. E.g. grass blocks were called grass

## Added in 1.12:
- Server#getEntity(UUID uuid). Prior to 1.12, getEntity used another class called UUID, those are not compatible somehow

## Added in 1.11:
- Curse of Vanishing. Enchantment.VANISHING_CURSE is used in AngelChest.java
